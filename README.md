## Application Overview
1. A simple application which helps vendors to reserve items from an available list.
2. The application is built on the Ethereum Blockchain


## Problem Solved
1. The applicaation helps vendors to reserve certain items.
2. In Supply chain sometimes it becomes difficult to maintain which vendor is ordering what, but with the Blockchain we can maintain all of that easily and also have smart contracts in place which we help us define any rules

## Assumptions
1. Since Ganache gives us 10 addresses to play around with, here it is assumed that these 10 address are the vendors who want to reserve certain items.
2. For now we are assuming that we only have 3 items and each item has only 10 units available initially.
3. We are not calculating total prices of items purchased etc
